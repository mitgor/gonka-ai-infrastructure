# Project Milestones: Gonka Tokenomics

## v1.1 Economic Modeling (Shipped: 2026-02-07)

**Delivered:** Five professional-grade Excel workbooks modeling Gonka Network token economics with 70 parameterized assumptions, cross-model dashboard, and what-if scenario analysis for leadership decision-making.

**Phases completed:** 1-9 (21 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Built 70-parameter foundation with confidence levels and full v1.0 research source citations
- Created 5 interconnected Excel models: Emission Schedule, Token Price, Fee Transition, Host Profitability, Treasury & POL
- Assembled master workbook with 8-tab structure, cross-model dashboard (8 KPIs, 3 charts), and bidirectional navigation
- Generated 4 standalone workbooks with filtered assumptions, glossaries, scenario narratives, and what-if toggles
- Applied professional polish: cell protection, print-ready layouts, cross-platform validation (Excel + Google Sheets)
- Achieved 57/57 requirements (49 must-have + 8 should-have) with zero tech debt

**Stats:**

- 128 files created/modified, 41,003 insertions
- 5,643 lines of Python across 19 source files
- 9 phases, 21 plans
- 3 days from milestone start to ship (2026-02-05 to 2026-02-07)
- ~57 minutes total execution time

**Git range:** `69ed09e` -> `c34bd58`

**What's next:** Smart contract implementation, governance proposals, or additional modeling (IL, Monte Carlo)

## v1.0 Tokenomics Research & Optimization (Shipped: 2026-02-05)

**Delivered:** Comprehensive macro-tokenomics research producing 10 prioritized, fully parameterized recommendations for fine-tuning Gonka Network tokenomics.

**Phases completed:** 1 (8 plans total across 3 waves)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Produced 5 deep research documents (46,230+ words, 100+ sources) covering POL, real yield, veGNK governance, fee transition stress test, and GPU economics
- Updated 3 existing research documents to latest versions (Macro Research v2.0, Deep Analysis v3.0, Tokenomics Explained v3.0)
- Created definitive Fine-Tuning Recommendations capstone document with 10 actionable recommendations, 3-phase implementation roadmap, risk matrix, and dependency graph
- Identified competitive moat: no competing AI compute network (Akash, Render, Bittensor) offers genuine real yield distribution
- Designed enhanced revenue allocation model (70/20/5/5) with continuous TWAP buyback-burn mechanism
- Specified veGNK governance system with flash loan attack mitigation and 3-phase rollout plan

**Stats:**

- 12,985 lines across 9 deliverable documents
- 38 files created/modified, 16,945 insertions
- 1 phase, 8 plans, 11 tasks
- 12 days from project start to ship (2026-01-24 to 2026-02-05)

**Git range:** `eac88ab` → `69ed09e`

**What's next:** Implementation planning for tokenomics enhancements (smart contracts, governance proposals, oracle integration)
